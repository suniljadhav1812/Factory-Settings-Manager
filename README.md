# Factory Settings Manager

A simple application for managing factory parameters using Streamlit. This tool allows users to view and possibly modify factory-related settings stored in a local SQLite database.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- Interacts with an SQLite database (`parameters.db`)
- Handles data using Pandas and NumPy
- Modular code structure (separate pages directory)
